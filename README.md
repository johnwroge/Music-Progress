# Music-Progress
A way for musicians to create helpful practice sheets. The idea of this app was developed 
from The Musicians Way by Gerald Klickstein. 

To start, enter information on in each form element and submit. Next, navigate to next text page. 
You have the option of downloading a pdf of the final practice sheet.
